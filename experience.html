            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>UI/UX designer &amp; developer specialist, with experience in designing and developing custom and dynamic sites and applications. I thrive by developing complete design solutions from concept to completion, either as sole designer or as part of a symbiotic team.</p>
            <p>With a classical art and architecture background complemented by a highly technical CSS and XHTML skill set, I have thus far had a very unique and exciting career. I have worked in almost all areas of design, and I am always seeking new technical challenges, all while looking to further expand my knowledge base.</p>
            
            <h2>Skill Set</h2>
            <p>Extensive dynamic web (HTML5, CSS3, SVG and reactive design), strong professional UI/UX knowledge base, custom &amp; front-end development, branding, identity development, and team management.</p>
            <p>Strong and deep background in print design as well. Experience in brochures, magazines, and all other facets of print design.
Very personable, forward thinking, and I excel at working with different departments &amp; people to bring a project together.</p>
            
            <h2>Print Experience</h2>
            <p><em>(Graphic Designer → Creative Director)</em><br />
Extensive experience developing for-print materials, packaging, and company identity for a full-service, in-house design firm at a multimillion dollar nutritional supplement company. Learned the visual marketing and design process by working closely with other designers, company founders/visionaries, and marketing and sales specialists.</p>
            
            <h2>Web Experience</h2>
            <p>(Web Designer → Senior Web Designer/Developer → User Interface Designer)<br />
Developed a technical web focus, at a high-production legal and medical website development firm. Built and maintained medical and legal sites consisting of thousands of pages. Designed, cloned, and re-coded templates and learned to develop within a highly structured, fast turn-around environment.</p>
            <p>Moved to an ambitious startup for social-networking/streaming video sharing sites, building new coding skills and working closely with engineers to build and expand a dynamic data-driven site. Designed and built white label sites, and worked directly with partners such as Lucas Film, Paramount, FOX Studios, and the NBA.</p>
            <p>Partnered at a boutique cutting edge development firm, I work with different accounts in the multiple roles of product manager, UI/UX designer, and front end developer. Additionally, I interface with clients and their technical teams for design feedback, development and implementation.</p>
            <p>Sole UI/UX designer and front-end developer for Archetype®, a bleeding-edge web based software tool for genomic research, discovery and optimization. I started with Archetype® at concept to develop an ease-of-use work flow for a powerful and unparalleled genomic research and design tool.</p>
            <p>Developed the HTML/CSS and JavaScript frameworks for the flagship software product, DriveCam®. My responsibilities include working with the UX team to establish best practices and responsive flexibility, while deciding upon the best frameworks to rebuild the customer-facing video management and analysis site. I then work with the development team to coordinate the proper build and build schedule.</p>
